- [ ] **ADD TESTS MORON**
- [ ] Refactor to Todo "objects" instead of just `String` keys and `bool` statuses
- [ ] Expand the definition of Todo (Title, Body/Content, Date Due, Date Created, Date Modified, Tags)
- [X] ~~Add utility functions for file system interaction~~
- [ ] Add back-ups for [db.txt](.\db.txt)
- [X] ~~Create interface for saving and loading data~~
- [X] ~~Add sources for saving / loading other than plain text files~~
- [X] ~~Maybe add serialization with `serde` to ease the above point~~
- [ ] Create transactional system so errors don't brick the whole system
- [ ] Create service (app-wide ***interface*** type service, not daemon/winservice) for todo-list and todo-list entries
- [ ] Clean up `state` mod, focusing on React/Redux style state management. Actions are already in place, are reducers necessary?
- [ ] Clean up crappy code in general
- [ ] Add layered configuration (either `config` or `figment`)
- [ ] Add terminal colors for prettier output (`owo-colors`)
